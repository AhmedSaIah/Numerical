# Numerical Project (M352)
## How to run?
You have 2 folders:
  1) BeforeGUI: which contains theories and numerical examples only.
  2) AfterGUI: which contains the Matlab GUI (.mlapp) integerated with the script (.m).
for the "BeforeGUI" you can run it on "matlab or octave" and you can edit the functions manually. 
## How to run the "AfterGUI" Version?
Steps:
  1) Type in the command window "heat_eq" or "laplace_eq" or "ODEs_system" or "wave_equation".
  2) A different GUI will open corresponding to the command you've chosen previously.
  3) Type the inputs required and It will export to you an image "solution_plot.png".
## How does it work?
-  We've made a different GUI for every numerical solution.
-  After hitting the button the app will be closed and the the function or the algorithm will be executed, and every label will be parsed to the function scripts.
-  After the script has finished, it will print the photo to the current workspace with name "solution_plot.png".
